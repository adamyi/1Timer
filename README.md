MUN Timer for Mac
------
A simple MUN Timer for Mac OS. It offers two timers inside, one for individual timing while the other for whole timing.

### Usage

Set the individual time (seconds), total time (seconds). Click "Reset". Then click "Start" to start timing, click "Next" for another speaker. When the time left for one individual equals to the alarm time set, it will play an alarm sound to remind the delegate to finish his or her speech in a short period of time. Set the alarm time to "-1" to disable the alarming function.
